						<LearningObjective>
							<LearningObjective>---Interpret a multiplication equation as a comparison, e.g., interpret 35 = 5 * 7 as a statement that 35 is 5 times as many as 7 and 7 times as many as 5. Represent verbal statements of multiplicative comparisons as multiplication equations.</LearningObjective>
						</LearningObjective>
						<LearningObjective>
							<LearningObjective>---Multiply or divide to solve word problems involving multiplicative comparison, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem, distinguishing multiplicative comparison from additive comparison.</LearningObjective>
						</LearningObjective>
						<LearningObjective>
							<LearningObjective>---Solve multistep word problems posed with whole numbers and having whole-number answers using the four operations, including problems in which remainders must be interpreted. Represent these problems using equations with a letter standing for the unknown quantity. Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies including rounding</LearningObjective>
